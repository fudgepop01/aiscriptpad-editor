# aiscriptpad-editor README

This is an extension developed to assist in the editing of files generated by
[AIScriptPad](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pclv5x1vmk8o6fh/AIScriptPad2.0PM.zip?dl=0),
a separate program created/modified by `Mr. AI | Sluigi123`, and `Bero`.

**The Supported File Types Include:**
- `.as`
- `.aipd`
- `.atkd`

This extension adds the following features to vscode when editing those files:

- reading configuration from a given `include` folder
  - this can be configured in settings
  - defaults to `[current workspace root]/Include` as `./Include`
- autocompletion with argument support and documentation
- hover documentation
- jump to referenced label
  - done by ctrl+clicking on `Seek` or `Jump` instructions
- syntax highlighting
